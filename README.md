# Versions
- **Version 4.0** : Stable support for JIRA 8. Extra field placement is now correctly set. Still a known issue with colors not updated correctly (missing refresh event will be added in a future update). Add NEW feature to add color on the Epics button in the Epic panel in backlog view (use the color set from the Epic panel). Reduced height of all lines in backlog view to add more lines on screen (can be switched to OFF in the configuration section of the script). Small cleanup of unused functions.
- **Version 3.9** : Add preliminary support for JIRA 8. New function to detect Jira version and apply correct script branch. Repair broken extra fields on JIRA 8 - WORK IN PROGRESS - NEED MORE WORK but functionnal. **Known issue** : line colorization is not correctly updated in backlog and sprint view. Partial update. Need to rework this script section. Some code cleanup - Prepare for version 4.0 !
		    
- **Version 3.3** : Add new feature to expand all the possible workflow action (transitions) from the current status in the issue Jira page. You can add background color to that action buttons to add action categorization (like lozenge color code into Jira).

If you need to add specific statuses, please ask for an update (see capture below).
                    New feature with Kanban boards to have a better visibility for columns that have busted their limits (max and min). Now the column color is extended to the header and the title of the header is tweaked for better warning visibility (see capture below).

# Features

PimpMyJira! support the following features :

- Add one or multiples extra fields as a 'fancy' label in the Backlog and Work view for Agile boards. You can by example add 'Components' and 'Due Date' field for a better visibility on your project management.
- Multiples entry for the same field are parsed and will be screened like this : "entry1, entry2, etc..."
- You can configure which field you want by using the JIRA board configure screen, in the section ['Card Layout'](https://confluence.atlassian.com/agile/jira-agile-user-s-guide/configuring-a-board/customising-cards#CustomisingCards-fieldsAddingfieldstocards)
- Tooltip support on MouseOver for each label for full description and type of field.
- You can expand card color on the Board view for a better visibility of each issue types.
- The color for each issue types can be configured directly in the Board configuration, in section ['Card colors'](https://confluence.atlassian.com/agile067/jira-agile-user-s-guide/configuring-a-board/customising-cards).
- You are able to remove the issue type icon in order to gain some space on the card and if it's redondant with the card color for you.
- Flagged issues will stay in Yellow. Issue color will not override the flag color.
- Most common Statuses added as extra field are now automaticaly detected and formatted like JIRA status lozenge. Blocking statuses are put in red for better visibility ('Need More Info',  'Waiting For' and 'Suspended').

# Future

- ~~Remove the 'timer' for parsing the DOM and find a way to bind to the success to the last Ajax call to render the new DOM.~~ (DONE in v2.0)
- The userscript should be compatible with 'native' Google Chrome user script system. (without using TamperMonkey)
- Be able to add different color on each components randomly.
- Retreive the list of components for a project and give color attribute which is unique for each.
- Adding multiple fields will use different colors.
